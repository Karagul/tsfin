# Time Series Finance

This project implements classes for financial instruments and curves. It is built on top of
[Time Series I/O](https://github.com/LANXDEV/tsio) and [QuantLib-Python](https://www.quantlib.org/). The objects in this
project are all based on the Time Series model, in the sense of the [Time Series I/O project](https://github.com/LANXDEV/tsio),
and provide similar features in addition to standard financial calculations. The classes and tools defined here might be
 of great help in building financial applications.
